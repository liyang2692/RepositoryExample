1, clone a repository to current location:
	git clone <repository_URL_SHH>

2, Updating the remote repository or sync-ing it with the local version consists of three steps:
check status of git repository:
	git status
Staging the changes.
	git add python_code.py
Committing them.
	git commit -m <message>
Pushing them to the remote repository.
	git push

3, fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
	git pull
